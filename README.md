# ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ The Causeway

A tribute to the shutting down of the Causeway in 2020/21.

On March 18th 2020, Malaysia instituted a nationwide movement 
control order which included closing the nation's borders. This meant 
that the Johor-Singapore Causeway would close down. It was once the 
busiest land route in the world but was now deserted.

This website allows you to compare what traffic was once like on the Causeway 
with what it is now. You can choose different times and different dates. FYI: the Causeway 
is traditionally very busy in the early morning and in the evening.
